# GovTech Tech Challenge: Agentic Policy Data Analytics Platform

## Section 1: Technical Assessment

### Problem Statement
Policy researchers and analysts need an intelligent system to extract, process, and analyse datasets from multiple government sources (DOS SingStat, MOM Statistics, Data.gov.sg, and internal systems). Manual processes are time-consuming and error-prone. Your challenge is to build a full-stack agentic solution that automates these workflows and generates actionable insights through an intuitive web interface.

### Challenge Overview
Build an agentic policy data analytics platform that demonstrates your ability to work with autonomous agents, full-stack development, multi-cloud LLM integration, and comprehensive testing. You have complete freedom in your technical approach and implementation choices.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Multi-Agent System
Implement at least **3 autonomous agents** that collaborate to accomplish analytical tasks:
* **Data Coordinator Agent:** Plans research workflows and delegates tasks
* **Data Extraction Agent:** Extracts data from multiple government sources
* **Analytics Agent:** Processes data and generates insights

*Demonstrate agent orchestration, coordination, and how agents work together autonomously.*

### 2. Government Data Integration
* Extract data from **at least 2 different sources**: DOS SingStat, MOM Statistics, Data.gov.sg, or mock internal databases
* Handle different data formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, APIs)
* Implement error handling for API failures and missing data
* Show data quality validation and cleaning processes

### 3. Intelligent Analysis & Insights
* Perform meaningful statistical analysis (trends, patterns, correlations)
* Generate policy-relevant insights (e.g., employment trends, sector analysis)
* Create visualisations to communicate findings
* Produce structured reports with data source citations

### 4. Full-Stack Web Application
#### Frontend (TypeScript + Next.js/React)
* Natural language query input interface
* Real-time agent activity monitoring showing reasoning steps
* Interactive data visualisation dashboard
* Analysis history and export functionality

#### Backend (Python)
* RESTful API with proper error handling
* Asynchronous task processing for long-running analyses
* Database integration for storing datasets and results
* WebSocket support for real-time updates

### 5. Multi-Cloud LLM Integration
* Integrate **at least 2 different LLM providers** (AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, GCP Gemini, or Azure OpenAI)
* Demonstrate fallback mechanisms between providers
* Use LLMs for query interpretation, insight generation, and report creation
* Show practical application of LLM capabilities in the agentic workflow

### 6. Agentic Framework
* Use any agentic framework of your choice (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or custom)
* Implement **ReAct pattern** (Reasoning, Action, Observation)
* Show agent decision-making and planning capabilities
* Handle agent failures gracefully

### 7. Comprehensive Testing
#### Required Tests:
* Unit tests for agents, tools, and API endpoints
* Integration tests for multi-agent workflows
* LLM-specific tests: hallucination detection, accuracy validation, consistency checks
* Data quality validation tests
* Performance and load testing

#### Test Documentation:
* Test plan and methodology
* Hallucination detection approach
* Test results and coverage reports

### 8. DevOps & Deployment
* **Containerisation:** Docker and Docker Compose setup
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment configuration
* **Environment management:** and secrets handling
* **Documentation:** Clear deployment documentation

## Technology Choices
You are free to choose:
* **Frontend Framework:** Next.js, React, or similar (We propose **Vite + React + TS**)
* **Backend Framework:** FastAPI, Flask, or similar (We propose **FastAPI**)
* **Agentic Framework:** LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or custom (We propose **Custom ReAct Multi-Agent framework**)
* **LLM Providers:** Any combination of AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, GCP Gemini, Azure OpenAI (We propose **OpenAI + Gemini + Resilient Fallback / Mock Engine**)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, or others (We propose **SQLite** with SQLAlchemy)
* **Data Processing Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, or alternatives
* **Visualisation Tools:** Plotly, Chart.js, Matplotlib, or others (We propose **Recharts** in the frontend, clean and interactive)
* **Testing Frameworks:** pytest, Jest, or alternatives
* **Development Environment:** Any setup that works for you
